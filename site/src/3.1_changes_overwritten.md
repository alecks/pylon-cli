# Why are my changes overwritten?

> This isn't unfixable.

When you publish something with Pylon's online editor, using the CLI will overwrite its changes. It also goes the other way: editing something online will overwrite the CLi's changes.

This is pretty inconvenient, but it makes sense when you learn about how Pylon works. The only reason you give Pylon your TS files is to save them for when you come back. Since the CLI is local and you save your project to disk, there's no reason to send Pylon your actual project. All that's sent is the bundle and, in `main.ts`, the value of your configuration's `publish.main_content`.

It's recommended that you don't change the warning in `publish.main_content` too much; you don't want to lose all your changes. **Make sure to check that there aren't any files in the online editor that you care about before using the CLI**.
